This Python code is code to make files more secure by authenticating with .py files.
If the key file is detected, it can run the rest of the code in main.py and even ask the user whether to run it.
By writing code to open other files after main.py, you can strengthen the security of files other than this file.
If no key file is detected, it will create a new file with the given file name and overwrite it with a random string. Then delete this file.

Security can be made stronger by adding a hash value authentication function to this file.
Please improve the code according to your needs and use it.
